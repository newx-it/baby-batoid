these files are for ordering from JLCPCB!

you will most likely need to rotate some parts and align the switches and diodes, but as long as you take a quick look at the schematic in kicad that should be easy. contact me with any questions @ turnisaa.sgtworms@gmail.com :D

vial firmware is flashed with the QMK Toolbox, hold BOOT1 on the back of the keyboard while plugging it in and then select the file and hit flash
