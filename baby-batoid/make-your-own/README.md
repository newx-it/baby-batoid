these files are for ordering from JLCPCB and 3d printing/laser cutting your own case

you will most likely need to rotate some parts and align the switches and diodes, but as long as you take a quick look at the schematic in kicad that should be easy. contact me with any questions @ turnisaa.sgtworms@gmail.com :D
