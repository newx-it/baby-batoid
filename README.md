![alt text](https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/blob/[branch]/image.jpg?raw=true)

this keeb was designed using Noah Kiser's STM32 template and tutorial.

to order your own, use the files in ../baby-batoid/production

the gerber, bom, and positions files are (almost) up to date

C2 on the BOM will need updated, and positions will need manually adjusted in jlcpcb's PCBA setup if applicable
